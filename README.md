# Rotator

A web application to practice rotations in MMOs written in React

**This is an incomplete application and should be treated as a demo**

This application is intended to simulate the effects of pressing buttons in it. It will have cast times, global cooldown, animation timings and the resulting buffs and combos, as well as the potency output from the user. This can make it possible to practice strictly the rotations of a class without any mechanics or other things to distract the user.
